        <h1>Code of Conduct
        </h1>

        <h4>1. Professionalism</h4>

        <h5>1.1 Commitment to Excellence</h5>
        <p> Tutors are expected to offer high-quality educational support that caters to the individual needs of
            learners.
            This
            includes differentiating instruction to accommodate various learning styles and abilities.

            Tutors should ensure that their knowledge is current, aligning with the latest South African curriculum
            (CAPS)
            or
            any other curriculum being followed.

            Continuous assessment of learner progress is essential to ensure learners are on track to achieve their
            academic
            goals.</p>

        <h5>1.2 Punctuality and Preparation</h5>
        <p> Tutors must arrive on time for all tutoring sessions. If a session needs to be canceled or rescheduled,
            reasonable
            notice (at least 24 hours) should be given, barring emergencies.

            Tutors should be fully prepared for each session, with clear objectives and materials tailored to the
            learner's
            needs. This includes having textbooks, practice exercises, and other resources ready.</p>

        <h5>1.3 Confidentiality</h5>
        <p> Tutors must respect and protect all personal information of learners and their families. This includes
            academic
            performance, personal circumstances, and any shared sensitive information.

            The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) mandates that any personal data collected be used solely
            for
            educational purposes and not be shared without consent.</p>

        <h4>2. Respect and Inclusivity</h4>

        <h5>2.1 Non-Discrimination</h5>
        <p> Tutors are responsible for creating an environment where learners of all backgrounds feel valued and
            respected.
            Discrimination based on race, gender, religion, disability, socio-economic status, or any other protected
            category
            is strictly prohibited.

            Tutors should also be mindful of language barriers and should accommodate learners who may need assistance
            with
            languages of instruction.</p>

        <h5>2.2 Cultural Sensitivity</h5>
        <p> South Africa is a diverse society, and tutors should approach each learner with cultural awareness. They
            should
            avoid making assumptions based on a learner's background and should be respectful of different traditions,
            customs,
            and beliefs.

            Tutors should avoid introducing materials or discussions that may be culturally insensitive or inappropriate
            for
            the
            learnerâ€™s background.</p>

        <h4>3. Ethical Practices</h4>

        <h5>3.1 Academic Integrity</h5>
        <p> Tutors must promote honesty in academic work. This means guiding learners to complete their assignments
            independently and discouraging practices like cheating, plagiarism, or having others complete their work.

            Tutors must not complete school assignments, tests, or projects on behalf of learners but can provide
            guidance
            and
            clarification on how to approach them.</p>

        <h5>3.2 Avoiding Conflicts of Interest</h5>
        <p> Tutors must declare any conflicts of interest that could affect their objectivity. For example, a tutor who
            is
            also
            a teacher at the learner's school should avoid involvement in assessments of that learner.

            Any financial dealings between tutors and clients, beyond agreed fees, must be transparent and fair. Tutors
            should
            avoid engaging in any agreements that could lead to financial exploitation.</p>

        <h4>4. Boundaries and Relationships</h4>

        <h5>4.1 Maintaining Professional Boundaries</h5>
        <p> Tutors must keep relationships with learners strictly professional. This includes setting appropriate
            boundaries
            for
            communication (e.g., not communicating outside of agreed hours or for non-academic purposes) and limiting
            personal
            interactions.

            Physical contact with learners should be avoided, and all communication should remain focused on educational
            matters.</p>

        <h5>4.2 Avoiding Inappropriate Relationships</h5>
        <p> Tutors must not engage in any form of romantic or sexual relationships with learners. This applies
            regardless of
            the
            age of the learner and could result in criminal charges, particularly if the learner is a minor.

            If a tutor feels that boundaries may be at risk of being crossed, they must address the issue immediately by
            reinforcing professional limits and, if necessary, seek external advice or intervention.</p>

        <h5>4.3 No Exploitation</h5>
        <p> Tutors must not take advantage of their position to exploit learners or their families for personal gain.
            This
            includes financial exploitation, such as overcharging for services, or soliciting gifts or favors from
            learners
            or
            their families.</p>

        <h4>5. Health and Safety</h4>

        <h5>5.1 Safe Learning Environment</h5>
        <p> Tutors must provide a safe physical or virtual environment for tutoring sessions. If sessions are held in
            person,
            tutors should ensure that the location is free from hazards and conducive to learning.

            In an online environment, tutors should ensure that learners are not exposed to inappropriate content and
            that
            their
            data and privacy are protected through the use of secure platforms.</p>

        <h5>5.2 Child Protection</h5>
        <p> Tutors who work with minors must be aware of South Africa's child protection laws, including the Children's
            Act
            and
            the Sexual Offences Act. They have a duty to report any signs of abuse, neglect, or exploitation to the
            appropriate
            authorities.

            Tutors should not be alone with minors in isolated settings without the consent of a parent or guardian, and
            all
            tutoring should be conducted in a safe and visible environment.</p>

        <h4>6. Continuous Development</h4>

        <h5>6.1 Lifelong Learning</h5>
        <p> Tutors should actively pursue professional development opportunities to improve their teaching skills. This
            could
            include attending workshops, enrolling in additional training, or staying updated with changes in the
            curriculum.

            Tutors are encouraged to seek feedback from learners, peers, or mentors to identify areas for improvement in
            their
            teaching practice.</p>

        <h5>6.2 Reflective Practice</h5>
        <p>Tutors should engage in regular reflection on their teaching methods and outcomes. They should adjust their
            practices based on the effectiveness of their sessions and the progress of their learners.

            Continuous self-assessment ensures that tutors provide relevant and impactful learning experiences.</p>

        <h4>7. Communication</h4>

        <h5>7.1 Clear and Open Communication</h5>
        <p> Tutors must maintain professional and effective communication with learners, parents, and any other
            stakeholders.
            This includes providing clear explanations, setting expectations for sessions, and discussing progress
            regularly.

            Communication should be respectful, timely, and appropriate for the context (e.g., email for formal updates,
            verbal
            feedback during or after sessions).</p>

        <h5>7.2 Regular Progress Updates</h5>
        <p> Tutors should regularly communicate learners' progress to their parents or guardians. This includes sharing
            successes and areas where improvement is needed.

            If a learner is struggling, tutors must be proactive in discussing potential solutions with the learner and
            their
            family, such as adjusting study habits or changing tutoring strategies.</p>

        <h3>8. Compliance with Legal and Educational Standards</h3>

        <h5>8.1 Legal Adherence</h5>
        <p> Tutors must comply with all national and local laws, including education regulations, labor laws, and the
            POPIA.

            Tutors must also adhere to any specific regulations regarding independent contractors or small businesses if
            they
            run their own tutoring service.</p>

        <h5>8.2 Tax Compliance</h5>
        <p> Tutors who work independently must ensure that they are registered with the South African Revenue Service
            (SARS)
            and
            comply with tax regulations, including filing income tax returns and paying value-added tax (VAT) if
            applicable.</p>

        <h5>8.3 Compliance with Educational Standards</h5>
        <p> Tutors must adhere to the standards set by the South African education system. This includes following the
            CAPS
            curriculum (if applicable) and being knowledgeable about any changes in the educational framework.

            Tutors should also ensure they meet the standards set by any professional bodies they are registered with,
            such
            as
            the South African Council for Educators (SACE), where applicable.</p>
